## Introduction

The English Premier League (EPL) is the highest level of the English football league system. Founded in 1992, the EPL quickly surged to become the most popular and the most commercially successful football league in the world. The league consists of 20 teams who compete for the league title and avoid being relegated to the second level of English football.

The league boasts itself as the most competitive league in the world where any team can beat anyone. While only 6 teams can consistently finish in the top positions, that premise still holds. This is why Leicester City winning the league in the 2015/16 season was a remarkable achievement.

Leicester City's win of the English Premier League in the 2015/16 season is one of the most remarkable events of sports history. It is one of those rare and shocking sports events where a team wins a game or a trophy even when the odds are overwhelmingly against them. In Leicester's case, they were given a 5000-to-1 chance of becoming the league champions. Their victory is even more impressive when the fact that only 5 teams have been named champions since the league's founding in 1992. Four of those teams, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, and Arsenal have massive financial resources where they can spend enormously on transfers and payroll. On the other hand, Leicester has only about a quarter of the financial resources compared to those teams. 

In this tutorial, we will look at how Leicester was able to clinch the title. We will gather football data to determine the team's performance and where they excelled at.  


## Getting Started

## Collecting Data

We will be scraping our data from various sources since most sources only cover a portion of what we need. For example, we will scrape one source for attacking data and another for defensive data.

The Premier League website contains most the data that we need. However, it is difficult to get the data from the 2015/16 season using simple web scrapping since the website doesn't appear to be static. Rather, it appears that the data is loaded from a server which always defaults into the 2020/21 season. We will just copy the rest of the data that we need into an excel file and convert that into a CSV file.

### Loading the data

In order to organize our data, we will have different dataframes for each portion of the data. Thankfully, our data is already organized since we are already scrapping different websites for each portion of what we need. Each website will have its own dataframe. 

## Tidying the Data
Three dataframes: attacking, defensive, misc (possesion, tackles, etc)
